#### Solution
An iOS & Android mobile app built on a content management system that contains web, coupon and promo code based benefits.

AT&T were offering many perks to their customers. The problem was each perk was on it’s own individual website. 

After a brief kickoff, I got right to work. We didn’t have much time so I started with Basecamp’s version of flows to illustrate our primary use cases. I worked with our development team by defining the content strategy for the custom CMS we built.

I created the wires.

I created the initial UI based on their recent brand update.

This was an ongoing project where I was tightly integrated with product management and development. We worked with the client on a feasible roadmap for our releases. I adhered to business requirements. I worked with our business analyst to write technical requirements based off my design. It was extremely important to be knowledgable of iOS and Android platforms. I needed to ensure our apps passed certification and were future proof by not using custom UI components. I paired closely with developers to ensure the designs scaled well across screens.

As the number of offers grew, I decided we needed a variety of templates that fit any offer we were given including:

* Web Offers
* QR code based offers
* Text Code based offers
* Limited time offers
* Location based offers
* Sweepstakes 

The app had a 4.5 out of 5 ranking on the App Store and was used by millions of users. It has recently been absorbed into MyAT&T <a href="http://www.mrclintmiller.com/portfolio/0_project/">(another app I had a big part in the design of.)</a>
