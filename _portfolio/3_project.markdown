Spy Camera is an iPhone app accessory for <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/178900/codenames">Codenames®</a> that uses augmented reality to show the spymasters the words their team needs to guess (and not guess!)

-Spymasters will no longer need to look back and forth from the the key card to the board to come up with clues

-As the game progresses, there will be no need to mentally “erase” clues that have already been guessed

- Gives the spymasters 3 ways to filter the key card: Red Team, Blue Team and Both Teams.
