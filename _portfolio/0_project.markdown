# Customer Need
*"I want to manage my digital lifestyle."*

# Business Need
*Rexamine AT&T’s app ecosystem and redesign the flagship consumer app: myAT&T.*

# Solution
*A 238 page final report consisting of research takeaways, job stories, customer journeys, job stories, wires, comps and strategic thinking around AT&T’s entire app ecosystem.*

AT&T came to us looking for strategy, design and tech recommendations around their entire ecosystem of 46 customer facing mobile apps.

First, I was tasked with researching the combined ecosystem, finding commonalities and looking for future improvements. With help from one of our developers, I wrote a script to pull in .JSON data from an app analytics site, into a google sheet for quicker analysis. I noticed some apps hadn’t been updated in over a year. I also saw what apps were rated the lowest. This gave us a list of apps that could possibly be eliminated or integrated into other apps. During this, I recommended our Strategy Director review app store reviews for qualitative feedback from real users.

Our leadership team put together a skeleton deck for a kickoff workshop. We had a lot of good strategic thinking, but I saw a need for more interactivity with the client. I added stakeholder interviews, Crazy 8s and SWOT analysis. I wanted to build consensus and make our stakeholders feel invested in the process.

After the two day kickoff we gathered our insights, the client’s research and the workshop findings. At the cross section of Business Needs, Customer Needs, and Best Practices, we identified 5 key Areas of Improvement:

Login, Customer Support, Billing, Streaming, Shop & Upgrade.

We outlined how our deliverables would build upon one another to produce the final presentation.

1. Stakeholder interviews give us **Business Needs**

2. App ratings, analytics & usability studies give us **Customer Needs**

3. Wunderman Thompson’s expertise & competitive analyses give us **Best Practices**

4. We define our **Areas of Improvement** by cross-referencing **Business Needs, Customer Needs** and **Best Practices**

5. **Job Stories** distill key issues and scenarios from the **Areas of Improvement**
