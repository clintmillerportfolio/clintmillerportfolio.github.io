<br/>
I am currently an Associate Creative Director at Wunderman Thompson Apps where I lead product design teams. Previously I worked as a UX Manager for Assurant, a Fortune 500 insurance company.

My focus is building a shared understanding of customer goals with my coworkers. I mentor designers, pair with developers and write user stories with project managers.

Working at an agency, you inherently work on a lot of projects. This has been a great way for me to continually refine my process. I’ve become a professional learner, problem solving across numerous industries. People tell me I’m great at explaining complex ideas in a simple way. I pride myself on my storytelling and presentation abilities.

In 2016, my work on the MLS Apple Watch app was highlighted on stage at an Apple Keynote.

In my 15+ years in design, I’ve stayed on the cusp of change, working in Web, Mobile and Voice.

In my free time I enjoy cycling and going on adventures with my 3 year old son.
